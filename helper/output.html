<i>"The front end can always pull it from the music API. ... If we want to provide more information to users on each song the front end should pull it from the music API?"</i> ; leads to redundant api calls, why continuously fetch data that we already got once.

<i>"I think storing a json object in our class diagram is looks like we have not designed it properly"</i> ; I don't consider this as a valid argument. Just because it makes our class diagram "look" incomplete does not justify the reduced functionality. We can simply make a note indicating that since app engine allows use to store json like this under another entity, there is no need to over-complicate our back end or front end and risk reduced flexibility by having to extract certain pieces of data retrieved from our music API.

						<td> Description: "whats downfall of storing it?" This then puts no limits on the data on the backend. We can't guarantee what is stored in the data json since we want it to be flexible. Which could lead to confusion and a need to map the data a certain way but puts this responsibility on the front-end developer.

"leads to redundant api calls, why continuously fetch data that we already got once." This is no different then fetching the data from our backend since the same data is being transferred only leads to one extra api call to an efficient music player API, i am sure youtube wont get mad about it.

"Just because it makes our class diagram "look" incomplete does not justify the reduced functionality." It actually makes our class diagram look like a hack.

But do what you want since it is your project

The area where I see "stop" useful would be for a Song entity. Songs that are in a stopped state could represents songs that have already been played and should no longer be displayed in the queue. This allows use to persist the entire song queue without worrying that these stopped songs might leak into the queue.</td>

In the User part of the Diagram, shouldn't the User always be required to have an ID regardless of if they are a guest or a host? Why is there a need for the empty constructor?

Also, there seems to be inconsistencies throughout the diagram, some parts are using Camelcase where others have the first letter capitalized.
e.g. GetID vs getStatus

Also, The Detailed Design part does not correctly relate to the diagrams. For example, there exists a resumeSong() process but does not actually appear on the diagram. Another example is that for both vote and Unvote, they both state that UserId is a string in the detailed design but was stated as an int in the diagrams.</td>

The reason i have two constructors for Song is I was unsure if the Song and User class' ids were to be generated by google app engine or on the front end since we need it to be persistent to the anonymous id. I thought this would give us more flexibility moving forward. The User() constructor would set the Id somewhere inside the constructor. </td>

Technically speaking, every numbered element *is* a subheading, and thus it's not inaccurate for it to be perceived as a title. In the example of "1.3.1 Concurrent Process", it is simply a Level-3 heading, or a subheading of 1.3.</td>

1. Guests and Hosts are both users, thus, just have one entity object called User which can be specified to be either of type <i>Host</i> or <i>Guest</i>.

All of the preconditions state that the user should be on a specific page, but the basic path lists how the user gets to said page. 
example:
    Line 198: Precondition --  Host is on Host page of the web app.
    Line 202: Basic Path -- From the landing page the user specifies they are a Host, and...
If it's a precondition, then it should be assumed that the user is already on that page.

This sentence is worded really awkwardly, particularly at the "and would only want to take a few seconds..." part. Does it need to be specified that the Guest *wants* to vote? 

Consider revising.</td>

The doctype format on the first line is written incorrectly. `<DOCTYPE html>` should be `<!DOCTYPE html>` so that it can be properly recognized as HTML5.

Also, header tags are block-level elements and should not be nested in paragraph tags.
This has been done on lines 78, 81, 84, 87, 106, 110, 119, 127, 132, 140, 145, and 155.

A suggested fix is to use `<span>` tags with css to properly mark it up, because `<span>` is an inline-element.</td>

				<td>Description: DBROWN COMMENTS:
- Create Party use case means that we will have a party class
- same for Song
- skip, play, pause are all things you can do with a Song entity (generally one page per action, but probably not in this case)

- Vote is an entity. Upvote is an action. No major object to these, as long as it is clear to the user

- Party must have a password attribute (pulled from req's)
--- reading any paragraph should give info about the analysis

Create Party Flow - Host:
- "get navigated" is an abomination....rephrase this. a user does not get navigated

- or sign into an already created party "this signifies to Brown that there can be more than one Host at a party." Make re-login EXPLICIT

- what do we mean by request songs? be more clear?

***************
- either can't remove songs from the queue -- power of the people.
- or Play It Now option for the Host...
***************

Access Existing Pary Flow - host:
- dont need to say host, it is made clear by the title
- this one needs to be rethought or rewritten but Joey missed what he said
-- needs clarification on multiple Host issue here as well

Access Party flot:
- same thing for guests here, made clear by title

- make clear how we stop peple from voting more than once / HOW do we uniquely identify a guest... needs to be much more explicit


Request Song Flow;
- where is the search going?
- what is the host has access to some paid place?
- is it upgradeable?


Upvoting songs
- need to know who the user is for this to work</td>

All it should require is whenever you make a call to vote, play-now, or next you'd send in the song id instead of the url, so you would probably have to add a field to your song model called id. Making this change will also speed up the apis since this will allow me to use get_by_id() which is a simple hash look up vs a full query.</td>
