								<p>Okay well if most can use a url then why store anything else on the backend? If the api gives back more than that it just used by the front end and backend does not worry about it, just stores url. Why store what the music API gives us?</p>

								<p>why not? Like I said before we want to keep this as general as possible. What if in the future we want to provide more information to users on each song? What if the music API terms change and require that we display information such as who uploaded the song, copyright information etc? Storing this extra data allows for more flexibility.</p>

								<p>My point is we are not creating any of this data so why store on it on the backend. The front end can always pull it from the music API. If the API changes the backend still will not change since the API change which are on the front end. If we want to provide more information to users on each song the front end should pull it from the music API? I think storing a json object in our class diagram is looks like we have not designed it properly

<i>"I think storing a json object in our class diagram is looks like we have not designed it properly"</i> ; I don't consider this as a valid argument. Just because it makes our class diagram "look" incomplete does not justify the reduced functionality. We can simply make a note indicating that since app engine allows use to store json like this under another entity, there is no need to over-complicate our back end or front end and risk reduced flexibility by having to extract certain pieces of data retrieved from our music API.

								<p>"whats downfall of storing it?" This then puts no limits on the data on the backend. We can't guarantee what is stored in the data json since we want it to be flexible. Which could lead to confusion and a need to map the data a certain way but puts this responsibility on the front-end developer.

"leads to redundant api calls, why continuously fetch data that we already got once." This is no different then fetching the data from our backend since the same data is being transferred only leads to one extra api call to an efficient music player API, i am sure youtube wont get mad about it.

"Just because it makes our class diagram "look" incomplete does not justify the reduced functionality." It actually makes our class diagram look like a hack.

But do what you want since it is your project

					<h4>Description:</h4>
					<p>I don't this stop song is necessary. A host has the ability to STOP a party which is the equivalent of ending it. Hosts can pause a song and then play a specific song simply by selecting the song in the queue. Have stop in the application will most likely confuse users.

The area where I see "stop" useful would be for a Song entity. Songs that are in a stopped state could represents songs that have already been played and should no longer be displayed in the queue. This allows use to persist the entire song queue without worrying that these stopped songs might leak into the queue.</p>

- "This section describes the decomposition of the system in a three different forms". I believe that the 'a' should be removed at the end of that phrase.

2.1.1 Class Diagram
- The argument 'Password' for the Party constructor shouldn't be capitalized
- Should be Green: Boundary Object (not GreenL Boundary Object)

2.2.1
- 'An interface for the user select whether to be a Host or a Guest' should probably be ".... user to select..."

4.3.1
- (Bootstrap Section) "The visual framework the PartyAll web application is utilizing is Bootstrap made by the people over at Twitter." Consider rewording slightly (mostly it is the ending that sounds off).
- (AngularJS Section)  "Traditional web pages work in the following way, ... " Consider using a colon instead of a comma.
- Several times in the Google App Engine paragraph at least a portion of Google App Engine isn't capitalized. All instances of Google App Engine, App Engine, etc.. should be capitalized.</p>

					<h4>Description:</h4>
					<p>In the Song part of the Diagram, shouldn't Unvote require a userId: int instead of a string. Also, what is the purpose of creating the two Song constructors? I don't see a reason why you shouldn't use just Song(url:String, id:int)

In the User part of the Diagram, shouldn't the User always be required to have an ID regardless of if they are a guest or a host? Why is there a need for the empty constructor?

Also, there seems to be inconsistencies throughout the diagram, some parts are using Camelcase where others have the first letter capitalized.
e.g. GetID vs getStatus

Also, The Detailed Design part does not correctly relate to the diagrams. For example, there exists a resumeSong() process but does not actually appear on the diagram. Another example is that for both vote and Unvote, they both state that UserId is a string in the detailed design but was stated as an int in the diagrams.</p>

								<p>Hey Royce all the things you brought i fixed awhile ago. The version you are looking at is old. Someone updated over top of my work. The reason i have two constructors for Song is I was unsure if the Song and User class' ids were to be generated by google app engine or on the front end since we need it to be persistent to the anonymous id. I thought this would give us more flexibility moving forward. The User() constructor would set the Id somewhere inside the constructor. </p>

					<p>In the SRS doc the individual definitions weren't numbered. We may want to keep the same standard throughout the docs.

Technically speaking, every numbered element *is* a subheading, and thus it's not inaccurate for it to be perceived as a title. In the example of "1.3.1 Concurrent Process", it is simply a Level-3 heading, or a subheading of 1.3.</p>

					<p>I am thinking this does not make sense. We have a songQueue attribute which holds the songs associated with the party. Is this not implied by the aggregation? If the answer is no, would we not need a guestList then in Party?</p>

					<h4>Description:</h4>
					<p>## Under section 2.1 of the Analysis:

###### Issue:
Having User, Host & Guest as entities objects is redundant. There is no need to have all 3 as entities.

###### Expected: 
Should be one of the following:
1. Guests and Hosts are both users, thus, just have one entity object called User which can be specified to be either of type <i>Host</i> or <i>Guest</i>.
2. Separate users out into two distinct entities as Hosts and Guests, dropping the need for User as an entity.

					<p>In the Party Controller Class it has "Vote for Song" going to "End Party", while in the User Controller Class it doesn't have "Vote for Song" going to "End Party". These two should be the same since Party Controller is the Host I believe.

Also is the "View Party" page the same as the "Vote for Song", since there is "Vote for Song" going to "End party" as well as "View Party" going to "End Party" which makes it seem like it's two different pages.</p>

					<p>Search for Song should have an option to return to View Party. That way, one does not have to be forced to request a song when he/she doesn't find a suitable song.

Likewise, users should also be able to go directly from Search for Song to Vote for Song to save the step of going of first going back to View Party and then to Vote for Song.</p>

However, to your point regarding Searching and Requesting a Song and then having to Vote for the Song, it can be implied that the system will interpret a request for a song as a vote from the requesting User.</p>

					<p>**Edit**: This happens all throughout section 3.2, so I'm going to join the whole thing into 1 issue.

All of the preconditions state that the user should be on a specific page, but the basic path lists how the user gets to said page. 
example:
    Line 198: Precondition --  Host is on Host page of the web app.
    Line 202: Basic Path -- From the landing page the user specifies they are a Host, and...
If it's a precondition, then it should be assumed that the user is already on that page.

This occurs in these areas:
- 3.2.1 (Line 202 contradicted by line 198)
- 3.2.2 (Line 238 contradicted by line 234)
- 3.2.3 (Line 274 contradicted by line 270)
- 3.2.4 (Line 310 contradicted by line 306)
- 3.2.5 (Line 346 contradicted by line 342)
- 3.2.6 (Line 382 contradicted by line 378)
- 3.2.7 (Line 418 contradicted by line 414)
- 3.2.8 (Line 454 contradicted by line 450)
- 3.2.9 (Line 490 contradicted by line 486)
- 3.2.10 (Line 526 contradicted by line 522)
- 3.2.11 (Line 562 contradicted by line 558)
- 3.2.12 (Line 634 contradicted by line 630)</p>

								<p>The precondition is for the event. The basic path is how the user got to the event that is occurring. Closing for now, if this is still confusing I can just rename precondition to Event Page or Page.</p>

								<p>Would the "Use-Case Name" not be the event that is occurring? 
Preconditions define the state of the software *before* the use case begins.

To my knowledge, the "Basic Path" should describe how to get from the preconditions to the action of the use-case, because otherwise it'd be redundant to describe from before the pre-assumed state of the software. </p>

					<p>Line 173: "The assumptions made when creating this document were that the app does not have..."
It switches from past tense (made/were) to present tense (...the app **does not** have...)
It's also a bit of a run-on sentence.

The whole section should be written in present-tense, active voice ("The assumptions for PartyAll are...").</p>

					<p>Line 163: "The PartyAll web app is meant to be used by guests at parties where he or she is engaging in social interaction and would only want to take a few seconds to use PartyAll to vote for the next song to play before returning to the party."

This sentence is worded really awkwardly, particularly at the "and would only want to take a few seconds..." part. Does it need to be specified that the Guest *wants* to vote? 

Consider revising.</p>

					<h4>Description:</h4>
					<p> I don't think this is really the topic of SQA, but this should really be addressed.

The doctype format on the first line is written incorrectly. `<DOCTYPE html>` should be `<!DOCTYPE html>` so that it can be properly recognized as HTML5.

Also, header tags are block-level elements and should not be nested in paragraph tags.
This has been done on lines 78, 81, 84, 87, 106, 110, 119, 127, 132, 140, 145, and 155.

A suggested fix is to use `<span>` tags with css to properly mark it up, because `<span>` is an inline-element.</p>

					<h4>Description:</h4>
					<p>DBROWN COMMENTS:
- Create Party use case means that we will have a party class
- same for Song
- skip, play, pause are all things you can do with a Song entity (generally one page per action, but probably not in this case)

- Vote is an entity. Upvote is an action. No major object to these, as long as it is clear to the user

- Party must have a password attribute (pulled from req's)
--- reading any paragraph should give info about the analysis

Create Party Flow - Host:
- "get navigated" is an abomination....rephrase this. a user does not get navigated

- or sign into an already created party "this signifies to Brown that there can be more than one Host at a party." Make re-login EXPLICIT

- what do we mean by request songs? be more clear?

***************
- either can't remove songs from the queue -- power of the people.
- or Play It Now option for the Host...
***************

Access Existing Pary Flow - host:
- dont need to say host, it is made clear by the title
- this one needs to be rethought or rewritten but Joey missed what he said
-- needs clarification on multiple Host issue here as well

Access Party flot:
- same thing for guests here, made clear by title

- make clear how we stop peple from voting more than once / HOW do we uniquely identify a guest... needs to be much more explicit


Request Song Flow;
- where is the search going?
- what is the host has access to some paid place?
- is it upgradeable?


Upvoting songs
- need to know who the user is for this to work</p>

								<p>For "... distributed to the Party's guests" I believe this phrase is talking about the physical party as opposed to the 'Party' created within PartyAll. Therefore, I think it should all be lower case ("...distributed to the party's guests.") instead of any capitals at all as is simply a guest at the party.</p>

								<p>i agree, @jmuia can we make this switch? All it should require is whenever you make a call to vote, play-now, or next you'd send in the song id instead of the url, so you would probably have to add a field to your song model called id. Making this change will also speed up the apis since this will allow me to use get_by_id() which is a simple hash look up vs a full query.</p>

"
It's actually pretty cool though, just out of curiosity how do you actually play the music as a host?
"
He was doing it on his I-phone. Is being a Host not mobile.
It seemed fine on my phone. He may be the on exception but we may need to dummy proof this app for i-phone users </p>

								<p>I just tested this on my iPhone (4) and created a party/played a song with no problem. It took a few seconds for the song to start played after it was queued but it played fine</p>

					<p>It looks like the functions on the popup for the song queue doesn't seem to work on the Z10. Tapping on either upvote, play or cancel doesn't seem to work. I can still exit out by tapping outside the popup.</p>

					<p>The pop-up that appears for the Host when he/she selects a song: "Upvote or Play Now? Would you like to upvote this song or play it now?". Would be better If we get rid of one of those sentences since they both have the same meaning.</p>
