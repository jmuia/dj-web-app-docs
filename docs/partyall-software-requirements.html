        <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            PartyAll is a web based application that allows guests at a party to democratically curate a playlist for the party they are attending. The purpose of PartyAll is to solve the issues and inefficiencies behind manually creating a playlist that a plurality of people agree on and to avoid having one person monopolizing the music. The issues and inefficiencies that manually creating a playlist for the party includes, but is not limited to, the fact that not everyone will be there at the start of the party to decide upon the songs, a group of people suggesting songs out loud at the same time will cause confusion and for some choices to go unnoticed by the group at large, and preselecting a song playlist means that the playlist will remain static throughout the party and not change as the tastes of the crowd change.
        </p>

        <h3 id="purpose">1.1 Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of this document is to illustrate the software requirements of the PartyAll web application. This document is targeted towards the developers of the application and to any users or individuals looking to gain an in depth understanding of the application.
        </p>

        <h3 id="scope">1.2 Scope</h3>
        <p>
            PartyAll is a mobile friendly web application that allows multiple people to collectively curate a playlist. Users of PartyAll classify themselves as one of two types, either a Host or Guest. A Host can create a Party or in other words a new playlist. A Guest, given an access key, is allowed to access the Party and request songs to be queued up. Users, (both of type Host and Guest) are allowed to upvote songs moving them higher up the queue as they gain more votes than other songs. PartyAll automatically traverses the queue, playing songs until the end of the queue is reached, or the Party is ended by the creating Host.
            A Party that a Host creates can be manually stopped by the Host or remain inactive (no songs playing) for 3 hours and be automatically stopped. There are no persistent user accounts, minimizing the steps required to go from opening the web page to starting a Party. The requirements for creating a Party are a unique name and password. Upon successful creation, the Host is presented with a system generated 6 character guest key which is distributed to the party's guests.
            Hosts sign in to their created Party using the Party name and Party password as credentials. Once the Host signs in, he/she hits the play button to start playing the song at the top of the queue. Once a guest has arrived, they can then use the Party guest key to view the Host's Party queue, request, and upvote songs.
        </p>
        <p>
            PartyAll aims to make the process of deciding on what music to play at a party as crowd-pleasing as possible.
        </p>

        <h3 id="definitions">1.3 Definitions</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Party:</strong> A Party is a playlist of songs that is curated by the Host and Guests. A Party can be paused or stopped, and songs in a Party can be upvoted to manipulate the order of the play queue. Songs in a Party can also be skipped by the Host of that Party.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Host:</strong> The Host is a type of user that can create a Party, sign in to an existing Party, pause music, skip songs and stop/delete a Party. This user provides Guests with a Party guest key allowing them to view the Party queue and vote for songs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Guest:</strong> The Guest is a party-goer who wants to decide on the upcoming songs. This user accesses a Party via the Party guest key provided to them by a Host.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Upvote:</strong> A user action which is to increase the vote count of a song by one. The more Upvotes a song has the higher up it moves in the queue. Users are allowed one vote per song in the queue.

        <p>
            The rest of this document goes into details on the various flows found in the PartyAll app. This includes how various types of users are expected to interact with the app, and how the app behaves.

        <p>
            PartyAll is a web based application with two major components. There is the PartyAll front end, and the PartyAll Service (back end).
        </p>
        <h4>Front End:</h4>
        <p>
            The PartyAll front end is the user interface component of the app. This is the component that is accessible to users. It consists of a mobile friendly responsive website that scales according to the device it is being displayed on. It supports a variety of screen sizes and resolutions, ranging from smartphones to TVs. The web application will be able to run on almost any modern device with a built in browser that has the ability render HTML5 and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <h4>Back End:</h4>
        <p>
            The PartyAll service is the component of the app responsible for storing Party data such as Party name, encrypted Party passwords, song queues, and upvote count for each song. Additionally, this service generates Party guest keys to send back to Hosts that create Parties. The service also stores the PartyAll front end's public key for verifying requests sent to the service are actually from the PartyAll app. The service is also responsible for rearranging the song queue when songs are upvoted, breaking ties in the queue by giving priority to songs added earlier. The service is also responsible for cleaning up Party sessions after 3 hours of inactivity (no songs playing).              
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="product_functions">2.2 Product Functions</h3>
        <p>
            PartyAll is a web based application. For users to access it, they visit the app's url on any device that has a web browser. Upon visiting the website the user is presented with an intro screen briefly explaining the app and an option for the user to specify what type of user they are. The user is allowed to pick one of two types, either a Host or a Guest.
        </p>
        <h4>Create Party Flow - Host:</h4>
        <p>
            If the user selects to be a Host they are taken to the Host page. Here the user gets to decide whether they wish to create a Party or sign in to an already created Party. If the Host chooses to create a Party, he or she is presented with a form. The form contains 2 fields: Party name and password. The Party name is the unique public identifier for the Party and the password is the password a Host requires to access the Party if they were to navigate away or log out. After successfully creating a Party the Host is presented with a success screen and on that screen there is a 6 character system generated guest access key. The guest access key is the public password the Host provides to his/her guests allowing them to view the Party playlist queue, upvote songs and requests new songs. The Host has the ability to play any song in the queue at any time by simply tapping on a specific song in the queue and selecting "Play Now".
        </p>
        <p>
            From here on in the Host can play songs, request songs, search for songs to queue up, upvote songs, pause music, play a specific song in the queue immediately, and end the Party.
        </p>

        <h4>Access Existing Party Flow - Host:</h4>
        <p>
            Hosts also have the option to access an already created Party. Upon doing so, a login form is presented, requesting a Party name and password. After successful login the Host is presented with the same Party screen along with the same functionality as described above. Any other Host that may have been logged in to the same party will be presented with a dialog explaining that another user has signed into the same party and that only one person can be logged in at a time. Upon confirming the dialog, the user will be presented with the landing page.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Access Party Flow - Guest:</h4>
        <p>
            Guests, before accessing a party, are presented with a login screen. The login screen consists of a single box asking for the user to enter a unique guest access password given to them by a host. After successful login, the Guest is presented with the guest perspective of the Party page.
        </p>
        <p>
            The guest perspective of the Party page shows the song queue of the Party, allowing Guests to upvote songs, request songs, and log out. Guests can un-vote for songs by simply re-tapping on the song they upvoted.
        </p>

        <h4>Request Song Flow - Host &amp Guest:</h4>
        <p>
            When a user hits the search icon from either the guest Party page or the host Party page, the user is presented with an input box. The user then enters the name of the song they wish to queue up and perform a search. Upon hitting enter to perform the search, an API call will be made to SoundCloud's servers requesting a list of songs that match the query. This list is then rendered and presented by the PartyAll front end. The user then clicks on the song they wish to request and verify that they do wish to queue up the requested song by confirming the dialog that appears.
        </p>

        <h4>Upvoting Songs - Host &amp Guest:</h4>
        <p>
            Users, from either the Host or Guest Party page can upvote songs in the queue by simply clicking on them. Clicking on a song that a user had already upvoted removes the user's upvote from that song or in other words, the user un-votes for the song.
        </p>

        <h3 id="user_characteristics">2.3 User Characteristics</h3>
        <p>
            PartyAll is intended to be a very simple and intuitive web app. As there are two different user experiences, there are also two categories of users.
        </p> 

        <h4>Host Characteristics:</h4>
        <p>

            The user hosting the Party on PartyAll is not required to have any in-depth technical expertise or training. Experience using a digital media player such as iTunes (play, pause, skip, etc...) will aid in the amount of time it takes the Host to become familiar with the application. Hosts also have the ability to vote for songs like Guests and therefore must also have the same characteristics as a guest (detailed below).
        </p>

        <h4>Guest Characteristics:</h4>
        <p>

            The PartyAll web app is meant to be used by guests at parties. At these social events, time is limited and people seldom want to be distracted from the things going on around them. Thus, PartAll is designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible, allowing Guests to quickly request their song or vote for their favourite songs and get back to the party. The Guest's technical expertise is required to extend only as far as being able to turn on his or her phone and access the web app. The app's user interface only has a few very clear options and therefore the user does not need to have any further training prior to use. In fact, as the app's target demographics is party-goers, it is not guaranteed that the user will be completely void of the effects of alcohol and therefore PartyAll is as simple as possible.
        </p>

        <h3 id="constraints">2.4 Constraints</h3>
        <p>
            The only constraints PartyAll has are the rate limitations in place by the YouTube API the app uses. At the time of this writing, YouTube's API limitations are 30,000 units/second/user and 50,000,000 per day. More information on YouTube's API quota can be found <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started#quota">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="assumptions">2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
        <p>
            The assumptions for PartyAll are that no admin interface is required and that any admin tools needed are automated into cron jobs (automated scheduled tasks the service runs) or are provided to us by the tools of the datastore we use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, this document was created based on the assumption that this is only the first iteration of the application, omitting some features that will come in future versions of the app. This allows developers to quickly release a minimal viable product that is both doable in a specified time period and is functional enough for release.
        </p>

        <h2 id="requirements_specifications">3. Requirements Specification</h2>
        <h3 id="external_interface_requirements">3.1 External Interface Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            The only external interface PartyAll relies on is the YouTube Music API it uses to power searching and playing music.
        </p>
