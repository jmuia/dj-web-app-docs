        <p>
            PartyAll is a web based application that allows guests at a party to democratically curate a playlist for the party they are attending. The purpose of PartyAll is to solve the issues and inefficiencies behind manually creating a playlist that a plurality of people agree on and to avoid having one person monopolizing the music. The issues and inefficiencies that manually creating a playlist for the party includes, but is not limited to, the fact that not everyone will be there at the start of the party to decide upon the songs, a group of people suggesting songs out loud at the same time will cause confusion and for some choices to go unnoticed by the group at large, and preselecting a song playlist means that the playlist will remain static throughout the party and not change as the tastes of the crowd change.
