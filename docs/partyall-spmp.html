        <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This introduction section provides background information for the rest of the document. It briefly describes the project, the client deliverables, the project milestones, and expected document changes.
        </p>

        <h3 id="project_overview">1.1 Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
            PartyAll is a web based application that allows guests at a party to democratically curate a playlist for the party they are attending. The purpose of PartyAll is to solve the issues and inefficiencies behind manually creating a playlist that a plurality of people agree on and to avoid having one person monopolizing the music. The issues and inefficiencies that manually creating a playlist for the party includes, but is not limited to, the fact that not everyone will be there at the start of the party to decide upon the songs, a group of people suggesting songs out loud at the same time will cause confusion and for some choices to go unnoticed by the group at large, and preselecting a song playlist means that the playlist will remain static throughout the party and not change as the tastes of the crowd change.
        </p>

        <h3 id="project_deliverables">1.2 Project Deliverables</h3>

These sections include:
        </p>
        <p>
            1.2 Project Deliverables - As project progresses original deadlines may need to be revised to suit needs of project.
        </p>
        <p>
		1.5 References - As more sources are used they are added to this section.
        </p>
        <p>
		2.3 Project Responsibilities - As roles change throughout project the details are added to this section.
        </p>

        <p>
        Each task mentioned in 1.2 is assigned to at least one small group to complete. This initial group is accompanied by another small group to perform software quality assurance on the given deliverable. Each group has a representative, however all major decisions are decided amongst the group. This project utilizes the democratic team organization approach. This means that all major decisions will be decided by the group in charge of the specific task.

        <p>
		The objective of this project is to produce a web application that democratically controls music played at a party. The main priorities of this project are to complete it with specific functionality and within the time specified (i.e. end of Spring 2014 term - August 20th, 2014). Budget is not a priority because this project does not require one. 
        </p>
        <h3 id="assumptions_dependencies_and_constraints">3.2 Assumptions, Dependencies, and Constraints</h3>
        <p>
		The assumptions of this project are:
		<br>i. Deliverables are completed in groups
		<br>ii. Each deliverable is reviewed by SQA groups
		<br>iii. Availability of software and equipment
		</p>
		<p>
		The dependencies of this project are:
		<br>i. Learning curve for technology group members are inexperienced in
		</p>
		<p>
		The constraints of this project are:

		<br>ii. Group members inexperience in chosen technology including hardware and software.
		</p>
		<h3 id="risk_management">3.3 Risk Management</h3>
        <p>
		1. Risk: Too many people using the application at the same time may overload the server
		<br>i. Application must be scalable
	    <br>ii. Application must be portable so it can be moved to a new server if need be
		</p>
		<p>
		2. Risk: Copyright infringement of songs
		<br>i. Web application must only access songs it has permission to use
		</p>
		<p>
		3. Risk: Host abusing privileges

		<ol>
			<li> Requirements Document</li>
			<li> Analysis Document</li>
			<li> Design Document</li>
		</ol>
			
		</p>
		<h4 id="software_test_plan">4.2.1 Software Test Plan</h4>
        <p>
        Testing the software made during this project is done by person programming the piece of code and SQA groups. For aspects of project that are viewable on a device, testing must be done on multiple devices, browsers and screen sizes.
		<br>These will include:
		<ul>
		    <li>Google Chrome</li>
		    <li>Internet Explorer</li>
		    <li>Android OS</li>
