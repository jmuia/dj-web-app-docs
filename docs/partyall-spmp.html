        <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This introduction section provides background information for the rest of the document. It briefly describes the project, the client deliverables, the project milestones, and expected document changes.
        </p>

        <h3 id="project_overview">1.1 Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
            PartyAll is a web based application that allows guests at a party to democratically curate a playlist for the party they are attending. The purpose of PartyAll is to solve the issues and inefficiencies behind manually creating a playlist that a plurality of people agree on and to avoid having one person monopolizing the music. The issues and inefficiencies that manually creating a playlist for the party includes, but is not limited to, the fact that not everyone will be there at the start of the party to decide upon the songs, a group of people suggesting songs out loud at the same time will cause confusion and for some choices to go unnoticed by the group at large, and preselecting a song playlist means that the playlist will remain static throughout the party and not change as the tastes of the crowd change.
        </p>

        <h3 id="project_deliverables">1.2 Project Deliverables</h3>
        <p>

        <h3 id="assumptions_dependencies_and_constraints">3.2 Assumptions, Dependencies, and Constraints</h3>
        <p>
		State the assumptions on which the project is based, any external events the project is dependent upon, and the constraints under which the project is to be conducted.  Include an explicit statement of the relative priorities among meeting functionality, schedule, and budget for this project.
		</p>
		<h3 id="risk_management">3.3 Risk Management</h3>
        <p>
        Describe the process to be used to identify, analyze, and manage the risk factors associated with the project.  Describe mechanisms for tracking the various risk factors and implementing contingency plans.  Risk factors that should be considered include contractual risks, technological risks, risks due to size and complexity of the product, risks in personnel acquisition and retention, and risks in achieving customer acceptance of the product. The specific risks for this project and the methods for managing them may be documented here or in another document included as an appendix or by reference.
		</p>
        
        <h3 id="monitoring_and_controlling_mechanisms">3.4 Monitoring and Controlling Mechanisms</h3>
        <p>
		Define the reporting mechanisms, report formats, review and audit mechanisms, and other tools and techniques to be used in monitoring and controlling adherence to the SPMP.  Project monitoring should occur at the level of work packages. Include monitoring and controlling mechanisms for the project support functions (quality assurance, configuration management, documentation and training).
A table may be used to show the reporting and communication plan for the project. The communication table can show the regular reports and communication expected of the project, such as weekly status reports, regular reviews, or as-needed communication.  The exact types of communication vary between groups, but it is useful to identify the planned means at the start of the project.
		</p>
        <h3 id="staffing_approach">3.5 Staffing Approach</h3>
        <p>
        Describe the types of skills required for the project, how appropriate personnel will be recruited, and any training required for project team members.    
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="technical_Process">4. Technical Process</h2>
        <p>
        This section specifies the technical methods, tools, and techniques to be used on the project.  It also includes identification of the work products and reviews to be held and the plans for the support group activities in user documentation, training, software quality assurance, and configuration management.
		</p>
		<h3 id="methods_tools_and_techniques">4.1 Methods, Tools, and Techniques</h3>
        <p>
        Identify the computing system(s), development method(s), standards, policies, procedures, team structure(s), programming language(s), and other notations, tools, techniques, and methods to be used to specify, design, build, test, integrate, document, deliver, modify or maintain the project deliverables
		</p>
		<h3 id="software_documentation">4.2 Software Documentation</h3>
        <p>
        Specify the work products to be built for this project and the types of peer reviews to be held for those products.  It may be useful to include a table that is adapted from the organization’s standard collection of work products and reviews.  Identify any relevant style guide, naming conventions and documentation formats.  In either this documentation plan or the project schedule provide a summary of the schedule and resource requirements for the documentation effort.
To ensure that the implementation of the software satisfies the requirements, the following documentation is required as a minimum:
		</p>
		<h4 id="software_requirements_specification_srs">4.2.1 Software Requirements Specification (SRS)</h4>
        <p>
        The SRS clearly and precisely describes each of the essential requirements (functions, performances, design constraints, and attributes) of the software and the external interfaces.  Each requirement is defined such that its achievement is capable of being objectively verified and validated by a prescribed method, for example, inspection, analysis, demonstration, or test.
		</p>
		<h4 id="software_design_description_sdd">4.2.2 Software Design Description (SDD)</h4>
        <p>
        The SDD describes the major components of the software design including databases and internal interfaces.
		</p>
		<h4 id="software_test_plan">4.2.3 Software Test Plan</h4>
        <p>
        The Software Test Plan describes the methods to be used for testing at all levels of development and integration: requirements as expressed in the SRS, designs as expressed in the SDD, code as expressed in the implemented product.  The test plan also describes the test procedures, test cases, and test results that are created during testing activities.
		</p>
		<h3 id="user_documentation">4.3 User Documentation</h3>
        <p>
        Describe how the user documentation will be planned and developed.  (This may be just a reference to a plan being built by someone else.)  Include work planned for online as well as paper documentation, online help, network accessible files and support facilities.
		</p>
		<h3 id="user_documentation">4.4 Project Support Functions</h3>
        <p>
        Provide either directly or by reference, plans for the supporting functions for the software project.  These functions may include, but are not limited to, configuration management, software quality assurance, and verification and validation.  Plans for project support functions are developed to a level of detail consistent with the other sections of the SPMP.  In particular, the responsibilities, resource requirements, schedules and budgets for each supporting function must be specified.  The nature and type of support functions required will vary from project to project, however, the absence of a software quality assurance, configuration management, or, verification and validation plan must be explicitly justified in project plans that do not include them.
		</p>
		<h2 id="work_packages_schedule_and_budget">5. Work Packages, Schedule, and Budget</h2>
        <p>
        Specify the work packages, dependency relationships, resource requirements, allocation of budget and resources to work packages, and a project schedule.  Much of the content may be in appendices that are living documents, updated as the work proceeds.
		</p>
		<h3 id="work_packages">5.1 Work Packages</h3>
        <p>
        Specify the work packages for the activities and tasks that must be completed in order to satisfy the project agreement.  Each work package is uniquely identified.  A diagram depicting the breakdown of project activities and tasks (a work breakdown structure) may be used to depict hierarchical relationships among work packages.
		</p>
		<h3 id="dependencies">5.2 Dependencies</h3>
        <p>
        Specify the ordering relations among work packages to account for interdependencies among them and dependencies on external events.  Techniques such as dependency lists, activity networks, and the critical path method may be used to depict dependencies among work packages.
		</p>
		<h3 id="resource_requirements">5.3 Resource Requirements</h3>
        <p>
        Provide, as a function of time, estimates of the total resources required to complete the project.  Numbers and types of personnel, computer time, support software, computer hardware, office and laboratory facilities, travel, and maintenance requirements for the project resources are typical resources that should be specified.
		</p>
		<h3 id="budget_and_resource_allocation">5.4 Budget and Resource Allocation</h3>
        <p>
        Specify the allocation of budget and resources to the various project functions, activities, and tasks.
		</p>
		<h3 id="schedule">5.5 Schedule</h3>
        <p>
        Provide the schedule for the various project functions, activities, and tasks, taking into account the precedence relations and the required milestone dates.  Schedules may be expressed in absolute calendar time or in increments relative to a key project milestone.
		</p>
		<h2 id="additional_components">6. Additional Components</h2>
        <p>
        Certain additional components may be required and may be appended as additional sections or subsections to the SPMP.  Additional items of importance on any particular project may include subcontractor management plans, security plans, independent verification and validation plans, training plans, hardware procurement plans, facilities plans, installation plans, data conversion plans, system transition plans, or the product maintenance plan.
		</p>
		<h3 id="index">6.1 Index</h3>
        <p>
        An index to the key terms and acronyms used throughout the SPMP is optional, but recommended to improve usability of the SPMP.
		</p>
		<h3 id="appendices">6.2 Appendices</h3>
        <p>
        Appendices may be included, either directly or by reference, to provide supporting details that could detract from the SPMP if included in the body of the SPMP.  Suggested appendices include:
A.    Current Top 10 Risk Chart
B. 	Current Project Work Breakdown Structure
C.         Current Detailed Project Schedule
