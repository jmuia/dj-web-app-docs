# PartyAll Documentation

Documentation will be extensive for the PartyAll web applicaton. For this reason we will avoid wikis in the other repo and dedicate this one to documentation.

SQA members can raise GitHub issues in regards to questions, concerns, or problems they see with the documentation.
